## Pricing Details

- LIMITED TIME OFFER: <span class="text-success">$200 / month / managed site</span> (90% discount over WordPress/Netlify Enterprise).  First month is <span class="text-success">FREE</span>.

	- Covers one <span class="text-white">SunStar Systems CMS</span>-managed public website (includes public Subversion hosting for sources, if desired, for 10 seats; <span class="text-success">$10 / user / month</span> for each additional.

	- <span class="text-success">Up to 10 GB</span> covering total SunStar Systems server filesystem storage.  Basically, this includes two source tree checkouts and one resultant build tree (also a checkout), and potentially the Subversion server's source DB if we are hosting it for you.  Includes `.svn` dirs (containing pristine copies of all your files), but not the results of site branch builds, nor the per user IDE checkouts, in calculating total size.  Additional storage available at <span class="text-success">$50 / GB / month</span>.

	- Production web hosting is not a part of this offer, but we can provide on a best-effort basis at  <span class="text-success">15 cents per GB</span> (in arrears) network transfer as metered by our (compression-enabled) web servers.  We expect to have a intercontinental POP network in place, with this same flat rate, and a market-leading 100% uptime SLA, before this offer expires in early September.

	- This is introductory pricing good through **September 7, 2020**, and includes <span class="text-success">unlimited seating for self-hosted Subversion source trees</span>.

	- SLA's and Premium Support Packages are sold separately; contact us for pricing on these items if you need them.

	- Unlike our competition, <span class="text-success">there are no add-on fees for required CPU cycles: neither for your builds nor IDE usage</span>.

------------
