## Pricing Details

- LIMITED TIME OFFER: <span class="text-success">$200 / month / managed site</span> (90% discount over WordPress/Netlify Enterprise).  First month is <span class="text-success">FREE</span>.

	- Covers one <span class="text-white">SunStar Systems CMS</span>-managed public website (includes Subversion hosting for sources, if desired, for 20 seats).
	- Production web hosting is not a part of this offer, but we can provide it based on provisioned bandwidth capacity add-on costs, or at  <span class="text-success">15 cents per GB</span> (in arrears) outbound delivery as metered by our (compression-enabled) web servers.
	- Up to 10 GB covering total SunStar Systems server filesystem storage.  Basically, this includes two source tree checkouts and one resultant build tree, and potentially the Subversion server's source DB if we are hosting it for you.  Does not include `.svn` dirs (containing pristine copies of all your files), nor the results of site branch builds, in calculating total size.  Additional storage available at <span class="text-success">$50 / GB / month</span>.
	- This is introductory pricing good through September 7, 2020, and includes <span class="text-success">unlimited seating for self-hosted Subversion source trees</span>.
	- SLA's and Premium Support Packages are sold separately; contact us for pricing on these items if you need them.
	- Unlike our competition, <span class="text-success">there are no add-on fees for required CPU cycles: neither for your builds nor IDE usage</span>.
