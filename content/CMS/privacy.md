## Outline

- NO SHARING/RESELLING OF CUSTOMER DATA.
- Cookies only used for Security / Accountability Purposes.
- The only User Identity components we log are your Google OpenID account's email address, and the user account you use to connect to whatever Subversion system underpins the CMS for the site to which you are making Commits.  The logging system tracks these alongside the basic Apache `httpd` access response logset, which includes connecting IP address, Request protocol with URL details, and client's advertised `Referer` and  `User-Agent` headers.
