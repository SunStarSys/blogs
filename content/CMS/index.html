## SunStar Systems CMS

The SunStar Systems CMS is an online, Subversion-backed IDE for developing and maintaining static websites with some basic CGI/SSI features.  It does this by either interfacing with a customer-provided Subversion server, or by using one of ours.  It builds each committed change using a lightning fast Perl5-based build system based on the Hollywood principle: it calls out to the customer-supplied perl modules (`path.pm` and `view.pm`) to do whatever the customer needs done.

We provide a Django-1.0 based template system based on a customized `Dotiac::DTL` module from CPAN, but can provide any other (secure) Perl-based Template system.  The build system is available on [github](https://github.com/joesuf4/cms) with a large collection of support modules to take advantage  of.
