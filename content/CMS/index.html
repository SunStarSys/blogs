## SunStar Systems CMS

<span class="text-success"><em>The Original Markdown JAM Stack.</em></span>&trade;

The <span class="text-white">SunStar Systems CMS</span> is an online, flexible, cost-effective, convenient, and peak performance Subversion-backed IDE for developing and maintaining static website content with some basic [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface)/[SSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes) features.  It does this by either interfacing with an [svnpubsub](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/server-side/svnpubsub/)-enabled, customer hosted Subversion service, or by using one of ours.  It automatically builds each committed change using a lightning fast `node.js` + `Perl v5.30.2` (the stable forerunner of [Perl 7](https://www.perl.com/article/announcing-perl-7/)) build system based on the [Hollywood principle](https://deviq.com/hollywood-principle/): it calls out to customer-supplied Perl modules to do whatever the customer needs done.  It also goes the extra mile and instantly distributes the change-sets for the build, atomically, to your live website servers / CDN providers.

Multi-gigabyte source trees are simply no match for it &mdash; full site build durations are measured in *seconds*, not hours and minutes.  The system easily sustains over `100 MB/s` for full site builds, but given its <span class="text-white">unique dependency management</span> functionality, it almost never needs to resort to them:

<span class="text-success"><em>it only builds what you need built.</em></span>&trade;

[REST compliance](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest) has its benefits to CMS users.  They'll like the fact that their browser's <span class="text-white">Back</span> button doesn't break the service; in fact it's an essential component of the <span class="text-white">Rollback</span> functionality. In an emergency site breakage situation, going back to the bad <span class="text-white">Commit</span> submission's result page will provide them with the ability to reverse merge <span class="text-white">that</span> errant applied change &mdash; at the click of a button &mdash; and rebuild the site back to a known good state.

We provide a basic <span class="text-white">Django</span> based template system derived from a customized `Dotiac::DTL` module from CPAN, but can provide any other Perl-based template system.  The Apache 2.0 Licensed [CMS build system](https://github.com/joesuf4/cms), together with a large collection of supporting modules to take advantage of within that tree, is available on GitHub.

**SPECIAL OFFER:** first month of service is <span class="text-success">FREE</span>!  See the full <a href="pricing">CMS Pricing</a> details.
