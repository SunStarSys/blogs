## SunStar Systems CMS

<span class="text-success"><em>The Original NoSQL Markdown website builder and online IDE.</em></span>&trade;

The SunStar Systems CMS is an online, flexible, cost-effective, very high performance Subversion-backed IDE for developing and maintaining static website content with some basic CGI/SSI features.  It does this by either interfacing with an svnpubsub-enabled customer hosted Subversion service, or by using one of ours.  It builds each committed change using a lightning fast `Perl5` + `node.js` build system based on the [Hollywood principle](https://deviq.com/hollywood-principle/): it calls out to the customer-supplied Perl modules (`path.pm` and `view.pm`) to do whatever the customer needs done.

Multi-gigabyte source trees are simply no match for it &mdash; full site build durations are measured in seconds, not hours and minutes.  But given its unique dependency mangement functionality, it almost never needs to resort to them: <span class="text-success"><em>it only builds what you need built.</em></span>&trade;

[REST compliance](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest) has its benefits to CMS users.  You'll like the fact that your browser's `Back` button doesn't break the service; in fact it's an essential component of the `Rollback` functionality. In an emergency site breakage situation, going back to the bad `Commit` submission's result page will provide you with the ability to reverse merge **that** errant applied change, and rebuild the site back to a known good state.

We provide a Django based template system derived from a customized `Dotiac::DTL` module from CPAN, but can provide any other (secure) Perl-based Template system.  The Apache-2.0 Licensed build system is available on [github](https://github.com/joesuf4/cms) with a large collection of support modules to take advantage of (within the aforementioned github source tree).
