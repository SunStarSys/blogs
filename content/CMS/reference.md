Title: CMS Reference

## Recommended Bookmarklet

Please be sure to install the bookmarklet on your browser toolbar by opening a "New Bookmark" dialog screen from your browser's menu and typing the following into the Location/URL field:

```javascript
	javascript:void(location.href='https://cms.sunstarsys.com/redirect?uri='+escape(location.href))
```

Without this bookmarklet installed you will not be able to browse the live site and instantly edit pages in the CMS by clicking on the bookmarklet. This is an essential component of the CMS and is therefore strongly recommended.

To use the bookmarklet simply browse your live production site (NOT in the CMS!), locate a page you'd like to edit, and click on the bookmarklet. You'll be taken to a page within this CMS that allows you to edit the content.
