Title: VDIO
Keywords: Startup,Project WBS,streaming video

VDIO was a sister site for RDIO (now defunct as well) dedicated to offering online streaming video &mdash; in the form of premium, recently released blockbuster films &mdash; to its customers.  My involvement in that startup spanned a six-month period in late 2011 - early 2012.  My main task was to develop a script for promoting a `postgresql` slave to a master across continents, following the Sun.  Other tasks involved documenting and promoting internal tooling for their `devops` concepts.

VDIO was eventually abandoned in March 2012 by its founders and folded into RDIO, who provided all of the funding for the startup.
