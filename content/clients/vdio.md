Title: VDIO

VDIO was a sister site for [rdio](http://www.rdio.com) dedicated to offering online
streaming video to its customers.  My involvement in that startup spanned a six-month
period in late 2011 - early 2012.  My main task was to develop a script for promoting
a `postgresql` slave to a master across continents.  Other tasks involved documenting
and promoting internal tooling for their `devops` concepts.

VDIO was eventually abandoned in March 2012 by its founders, who provided all of the
funding for the startup.
