Title: Broward Schools

My work with [Broward County Schools](http://www.browardschools.com) spanned a two
year period in 2005-2006 as one of their division's webmaster.  I developed and maintained
their site, working with their team to promote Child Safety as it relates to Broward County
Public Schools.  The tooling was based around
[Anakia](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/anakia.html) and XML sources.
