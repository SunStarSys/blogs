Title: The Apache Software Foundation

[The Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) (The ASF) is a 501(c)(3) public charity dedicated to the promotion
and development of open source software.  In the 8 years I served as a (contracted) System Administrator for The ASF,
the foundation tripled in both size and scope.
