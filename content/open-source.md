Title:  Open Source Projects

### Open Source Participation

Core to our beliefs is the innate value proposition of open source software.  Collaborative communities and their
surrounding networks have been a part of our work since the inception of SunStar Systems, principally in technologies
derived from or originated at [The Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).
