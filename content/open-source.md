### Open Source Participation

Core to our beliefs is the innate value proposition of open source software.  Collaborative
[lead-user](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_user) communities and their
surrounding networks have been a part of our work since the inception of SunStar Systems,
principally in technologies derived from or originated at
[The Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).
