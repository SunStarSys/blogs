Title: Git and Non-Repudiation

This essay really pertains to DVCS in general, not just git per se.  But I will focus
attention on git because it remains the most popular DVCS around today.

[Non repudiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) is an important concept
in security circles.  What it amounts to is satisfying an enterprise's need for acquiring
activity records that "cannot be walked away from after the fact".
