## The Problem

Perl 5's OO runtime method lookup has 50% more performance overhead than a direct, named subroutine invocation.

## The initial solution: Doug MacEachern's method lookup optimizations

Doug was the creator of the mod_perl project back in the mid-90s, so obviously writing high performance Perl was his fortÃ©. One of his many contributions to [p5p](https://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html) was to cut the performance penalty of OO method lookup overhead in half, by using a method + `@::ISA` heirarchy cache to make the runtime object method lookup for mod_perl objects like `Apache2::RequestRec` as streamlined as possible.  But it only gets us half-way there.

This isn't a trifling issue with calls to `C struct` get-set accessor methods &mdash; the common situation with many mod_perl APIs.  Perl's runtime method-call lookup penalty on httpd's `struct request_rec *`, that mod_perl exposes via the `Apache2::RequestRec` module, is on the same order of magnitude of the full execution of the call.  For mod_perl backed sites making millions of XS method calls a second, this is an awful waste of precious CPU cycles.

What Doug was looking for was a way to tell Perl 5 to perform the method lookup at compile time, the way it does with named subroutine calls.  Every time Doug tried, he hit roadblocks of either a social or technical nature.  Perhaps it's time to make another pass at this idea with the advent of Perl 7.

## Benchmark script

```perl
use strict;
use Benchmark ':all';
our ($x, $z);

$x = bless {}, "Foo";
$z = Foo->can("foo");

sub method {$x->foo}
sub class  {Foo->foo}
sub anon   {$z->($x)}

BEGIN {
  package Foo;
  use sealed 'deparse';
  use base 'sealed';
  sub foo  { shift }
  sub bar  { shift . "->::Foo::bar" }
}

sub func   {Foo::foo($x)}

BEGIN{@::ISA=('Foo')}

my main $y = $x;

sub sealed :Sealed {
    $y->foo();
}

sub also_sealed :Sealed {
    my main $a = shift;
    if ($a) {
        my Benchmark $bench;
        my $inner;
        return sub :Sealed {
            my Foo $b = $a;
            $b->foo($bench->cmpthese, $inner);
            $a->foo;
        };
    }
    $a->bar();
}

my %tests = (
    func => \&func,
    method => \&method,
    sealed => \&sealed,
    class => \&class,
    anon => \&anon,
);

print sealed(), "\n", also_sealed($y), "\n";

cmpthese 10_000_000, \%tests;
```

## Benchmark results

```perl

## Proposed Perl 7 solution: `:sealed`  subroutines for typed lexicals

Sample code:

```perl
	use v7.0;
	use Apache2::RequestRec;

	sub handler :sealed {
		my Apache2::RequestRec $r = shift;
		$r->content_type("text/html"); #compile time method lookup
	}
```

## Production-Quality Perl  v5.22+ Prototype: sealed.pm v4.0.1

Requires a [patched](https://github.com/rurban/b-generate/pull/2) `B::Generate` [Generate.xs](https://github.com/SunStarSys/cms/blob/master/Generate.xs) file.  Compile instructions for perl 5.30+ are available in the `sealed.pm` pod should you want to run mod_perl2 w/ ithreads and httpd-2.4 w/ event mpm, and not segfault ad nauseum at scale.  Tested on `Solaris 11.4` and `Ubuntu 22.04` on amd64.

For fun, try this [patch](https://github.com/SunStarSys/cms/blob/master/RegistryCooker.pm.patch) to `ModPerl::RegistryCooker`.  It enables the effects of `sub handler :Sealed {<script goes here>}` on all of your `ModPerl::Registry` scripts, something like [this one](https://github.com/SunStarSys/cms/blob/master/enquiry.pl).

See <https://github.com/SunStarSys/cms/blob/master/lib/sealed.pm>. Look for `bench.pl` in the parent directory.

This will allow Perl 5 to do the sample code's `content_type` method-lookup at compile time, without causing any back-compat issues or aggrieved CPAN coders, since this feature would target application developers. Not inheritable OO-module authors.
