Title: The DevOps "Movement"

### More than just giving developers root access!

Or not even that.  The big idea behind the "movement" is not giving developers
more rope; it's about ensuring better lines of communications between the developers
and the sysadmins in the enterprise.  Much of this is not new, in fact its a
rehash of the "agile" movement within traditional industrial supply chains
during the 80s.  Kanban boards are just the latest wave.

Constraint management is key to the process.  By first identifying any and
all bottlenecks in the system, you can refocus your efforts on optimizing
those resources to perform to maximum effect.  Optimizations beyond those
areas are almost always not worth the bother- the workflow will still be
constrained by those resources.

It is also important to distinguish between planned and unplanned work,
and how resources are allocated to those tasks.  Unplanned work amounts
to firefighting, and if too much time is spent on these tasks, the planned
work, which is the real business need for the enterprise, gets backlogged.
The bottlenecks in the system rarely can cope with unplanned work, so it
is important to have enough additional resources to cope with the load.

At the management level, a global change management perspective between 
both devs and ops changes is vital. Both sets of teams need to be aware
of each other's changes, ideally with planning details made available
along the way.
