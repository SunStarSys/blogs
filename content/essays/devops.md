Title: The DevOps "Movement"

### More than just giving developers root access!

The big idea behind the "movement" is not giving developers more rope; it's
about ensuring better lines of communications between the developers and
the sysadmins in the enterprise.  Much of this is not new, in fact its a
rehash of the "agile" movement within traditional supply chains during the
80s.  Kanban boards are just the latest wave.
