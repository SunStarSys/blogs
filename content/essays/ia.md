Title: Information Architecture

### Introduction

This is such a wonderful field to explore!  My perspective is that Information Architecture
covers the entire gamut of technologies relevant to the design, presentation, relationships,
and architectural constraints that cover every URL you serve over http(s), both publicly and
privately.  This essay is a high-level survey of my expertise in these areas; it is far from
comprehensive given the vast field it intends to cover.
