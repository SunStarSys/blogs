Title: Exponential Growth and COVID-19
Keywords: exponential, power, covid-19, epidemic, pandemic

Let me try to give you a qualitative analysis of what an exponential (aka power) function’s graph is operationally,
and how it applies to the covid-19 epidemic sweeping the planet.

### The Math

At first the exponential function’s values are microscopically small, and barely increasing over time (on the `x-axis`).
But the fundamental issue is that its rate of change is always in fixed proportion to its current value,
which means eventually it will hit a point where the increases are astronomical.

To illustrate this by analogy: imagine how fast you’d be going now if your car’s speed were always tied,
by a proportionality constant, to the mileage on its odometer. Under this hypothetical, for every fixed interval of time that passes,
both your car’s speed and total distance traveled *multiplies* by the same fixed amount (larger than one). In fact, it’s turtles all the
way down: your car’s acceleration, jerk, etc would all have the same multiplier.

On a logarithmic scale, power functions appear as straight lines.

### The COVID-19 pandemic

The `5-day-period doubling` of the total infected population count in NY this week, as well as the `3-day-period doubling` for the US,
are stark reminders of this effect (multiplier for both cases is 2).  The US biweekly figures are even more sobering: *everything*
increases 10-fold!

Here’s the good news- epidemics only follow exponential functions for the initial portion of the outbreak- eventually the rate of
change will flatten out and go negative, indicative of a falling level of the total population that’s currently ill.

The bad news is that the WHO is reporting that the world is nowhere close to that eventuality- and won’t be pleased with the
Logan’s Run US politics. According to them, the daily infection rates are still increasing (ie the epidemic is accelerating- the
world is still stomping on the gas pedal).

### Fallout

It’s not voodoo to get the epidemic to start moving away from exponential growth- that means it’s running into some
environmental resource constraints: some natural, like the infected population no longer being contagious after a period of time;
and some manmade, like a vaccine, or mass voluntary quarantine.

What epidemiologists are trying to accomplish is to kick that process off as soon as possible, because every lost day means an
accelerating loss of life, increased momentum of severe cases, and greater risk of totally overwhelming the health care system
as the graph crests.

Inevitably the flattening will happen, but if it’s not because of human social wisdom, it’s because the virus cannot reinfect past
victims, and it simply infects the majority of the population before petering out and lingering to infect newborns, or just
vanishing entirely.
